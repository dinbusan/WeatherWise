  <hr>

WeatherWise is a full-stack web application that provides real-time weather information for cities around the world that I created in 36 hours as a hackathon project. Built with a tech stack that includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, and MongoDB, this app is designed to be responsive and user-friendly.

Using the OpenWeatherMap API with Axios, WeatherWise retrieves the latest weather data for any city that the user searches for. Users can see current weather conditions, as well as a 16 hour forecast.

One of the standout features of WeatherWise is its ability to save cities to the user's favorites list. This means that users can quickly access weather information for cities they care about without having to search for them every time they use the app.

WeatherWise was created during a hack day project at </salt>, where the team had just 36 hours to complete a full-stack web application. Since then, the app has been updated and improved with better design and additional features.

As the developer continues to learn more about UI design and web development, they plan to keep improving WeatherWise and adding new features that make the app even more useful for users.

Overall, WeatherWise is a great tool for anyone who wants to stay up-to-date with the latest weather information for their favorite cities. Whether you're planning a trip or just want to know what to expect for the day ahead, WeatherWise has you covered!
